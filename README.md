# Parks-and-Green-Spaces
ISD1 Project.

Our project is aimed at making it easy for people to locate parks and green spaces simply by typing in their address or using their current location. 
This is aimed at families with children or people with dogs, and means to make it easy for them to see if an area is going to be suitable for them to move into. 
It will consist of a text box where you can input your address, with the option to use your current address, a map which shows the parks and green spaces near to this location,
and another read only text box which displays the address of the nearest park or green space to your given address.
We are also thinking of implementing a checklist so that people can select if they are only looking for parks or greenspaces.
